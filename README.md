# Tweet Classification problem

Here we apply Bayes Law to tweet classification problem. We represent a tweet in terms of just an unordered bag of
words. These tweets are also labeled with their actual
geographic locations, 12 different American cities. The task is to classify each tweet into one of twelve different
categories. We train the model on the training data and measure performance on the testing data in terms of
accuracy (percentage of tweets correctly classified). Use following on a command line to run this program:


```
./geolocate.py training-file testing-file output-file
```
